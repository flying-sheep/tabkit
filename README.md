tabkit
======

An addon with the bare essentials for configurability I missed in firefox, but which doesnâ€™t warrant bigger solutions like Tab Mix Plus. The philosophy is to keep the functionality as clear and unobtrusive as possible.

Currently it has two modules:

1. A middle click on the tabbar undoes the last tab closing (mouse replacement for <key>Ctrl-Shift-t</key>)
2. Makes unloaded tabs semitransparent (as they lack visual distinction)
